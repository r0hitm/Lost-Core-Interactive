    You go back to the main road and now look confused because all paths looks 
    the same. The infrastructure of that place is such that every building and 
    every particle seems same no matter from which section of the central road 
    you see. Now you don’t even recognize the path you came from. You are 
    annoyed at the poor design and management of the Alestrex’s - They could 
    have given a map for easy navigation, but they had not. You are pretty much lost.
