    You remembered that these bots fly at much higher speed so you can't outrun them, 
    and as these are weaponisez you can not hope to win against whole lot of them. 
    You quickly start running towards the dead-end ahead towards the manhole. You 
    safely reach the manhole, lift up the lid and jump inside sewers closing the lid back 
    before the bots have started firing. You start running away from that manhole as 
    it will not take much time for the bots to blast off the metal lid.
    You are inside sewers. 
    Fortunately, Alestrex builds the sewers not only for 
    drainage but also for other connections like electriciy and water. So the 
    so-called sewer is pretty clean with big two to four pipes going along the walls.
