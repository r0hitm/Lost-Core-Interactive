    You muster all the strength and dashes with full speed back towards the Main 
    Crossroad. The bots are constanly firing aiming at you. 
    You are running in a zig-zag pattern that you think will confuse the bots. 
    A bullet just hits your right shoulder. You fell down. Another one hits 
    your lower back. Just when you thought you are going to die. The bots 
    called off the firing and retreated leaving you bleeding on the street. 
    Your wounds are hurting a lot and your body is becoming numb.
