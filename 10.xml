    You see the bots slowing closing on you from all directions. 
    You decide to fight back. You shout loudly to ask for what you 
    have done wrong to raise security alarm. You try to convince you 
    are looking for the Security Council. 
    "Show us your Pass then." asks one of the bot.
    You show him your pass, which one of the bots take from you 
    and to your anger burns in front of your very eyes.
    "Now you are a Intruder, and Intruders are dealt with"
    the bots start firing at you. Hopefully, you had a Sphere Shield. This 
    creates a temporary barrier around you to shield you from the bullets.
