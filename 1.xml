    central tallest structure that is the pride of the Alestrex. It titled 
    "The Core of Alestrex", however what the real name was of the structure 
    is lost with the time. Suddenly you bump into a man wearing black Armour

    He lets you pass. You walk straight down the road where it splits into three.
