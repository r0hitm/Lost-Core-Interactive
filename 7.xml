    In this case, you will be trained in the royal academy and could directly 
    serve the Almighty King, Alestrex. But you will not recieve any salary 
    until you are a permanent soldier. 
    You seriously thought about the proposal for about 5 minutes and then you 
    came with an answer. 
    "Sir, nothing will make me more happy than serving the kind and Almighty 
    King Alestrex. Not getting the salary is not even near to being a issue for 
    me in this proposal. Kindly train me under you." 
    Security minister got startled and happy by your positive response. He laughed 
    and then said, "As you wish kid. I will manage the paperwork of all the students 
    like you who want to serve the king. Now you have one month. You will have to 
    shift to the dormitories of the Royal Training Academy. You nodded in 
    affirmation. 
    Then you were just about to leave when he stopped you and said, 
    "one more thing. I am planning to make a tour to Shooting area. You can spend 
    the whole month with your family or you can return in 1 or 2 day and company me 
    to shooting area. May be I will teach you the basics of holding a gun and 
    shooting it." 
    After that you left and reached your home and thought about the proposal.
