    Alestrex has very advanced and difficult Education policies, which 
    successfully prevents many students from passing their High School. 
    Furthermore, no student is allowed to repeat the school. Meaning if you 
    fail, you are failed forever; as Alestrex doesn’t allow students 
    to take exams again. 
    Thus, Alestrex is not a city of too many high school graduates. 

    You are very happy because your nightly hardships have blossomed into 
    the fruit you seeked - You have passed the High School. And you are 
    on your way to Alestrex Security Centre - anyone who passes high school 
    exams must meet the Alestrex Security Minister.
