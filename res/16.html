            You are run as far away from the manhole as possible. 
            You take some random turns to better escape the bots in case 
            they are in pursuit.<br>
            You now think of exiting the sewers. You see a manhole just ahead.
            You exit the manhole. You are now in a narrow street.
            At far at a distance you can see a bright light.

            ► <a href="12.html">Follow the light Source</a>  <br>
