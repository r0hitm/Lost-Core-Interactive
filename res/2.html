            You decide to go straight on the road and hoping to meet the Alestrex 
            Security Minister soon. You are feeling very much excited because less than 
            half of the students of Alestrex High school are able to pass and then meet 
            the minister. Instead of reaching Security centre, You have reached a 
            building with some highlighted words on the front which were "Alestrex 
            Security Shooting Area" You have chosen the wrong way.
