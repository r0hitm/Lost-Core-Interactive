            You are walking about about an hour now and now are completely
            exhausted. You are frustated - "The Council could have given a Map".
            You drink water from your bottle.
        
            Both sides of the street have very tall walls on which several security
            cameras are mounted. Ocassionaly, there is a very bright light emanating
            from the far straight ahead. You get curious to know the cause of 
            that light.
