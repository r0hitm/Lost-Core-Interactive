            You move your hand to your cell phone in order to call for help, 
            but the cell phone is not working. You try several times but nothing
             happens your cell phone is dead. 
            The sphere shield is fading away. You know you have to make the run 
            for the safety before the shield dies. You prepare yourself and 
            make a long leap away from the bots.
