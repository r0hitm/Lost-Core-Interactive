            You thought just leaving is not exciting so you decided to explore the 
            shooting area. You wished to enter the "Alestrex Shooting Area", however the 
            watchman do not allow you.
            "This is a Place for Alestrex's Armsmen to test their metal, kid."
            You told him that you are HS graduate. 
            "Still W/O your AA Pass I cannot allow you." he replied plainly.
            You decide to go back to your quest of finding the Security Council.
