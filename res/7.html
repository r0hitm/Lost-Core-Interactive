            It has been 10 minutes since you got on this section of the street, an alarm 
            goes off. Your stomach lurches. The alarm is very sharp and panicking. You
            look around you frantically trying to know the situation.
        
            You suddenly become sleepy, your eyelids are heavy. You try to keep them 
            open but can't hold off this heavy urge to sleep. You sit down by the sidewalk 
            your eyes closes into darkness. Last thing you see is the manhole lid on the street.
