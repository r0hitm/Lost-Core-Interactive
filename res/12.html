            You are running towards the source of light. The blue-white light is getting 
            intense and you have to cover your eyes to advance further. You are running 
            towards the light. Everything is now white, you realise but its too late. 
            You are in a place that is stark white. You cannot even feel ground or air.
            You start to suffocate.<br>
            "<b>BANG !!</b>" <br>
            An intense pain strikes your lower-back and the right shoulder.
            You fade.
