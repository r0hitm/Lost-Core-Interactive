            Alestrex has very advanced and difficult Education policies, which 
            successfully prevents many students from passing their High School. 
            Furthermore, no student is allowed to repeat the school. Meaning if you 
            fail, you are failed forever; as Alestrex doesn’t allow students 
            to take exams again. 
            Thus, Alestrex is not a city of too many high school graduates. 
        
            You are very happy because your nightly hardships have blossomed into 
            the fruit you seeked that is You have passed the High School. And you are 
            on your way to Alestrex Security Centre as According to State Policy anyone 
            who passes high school exams must meet the Alestrex Security Minister.
