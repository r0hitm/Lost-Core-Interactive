            The path is descending and you are full of excitement and joy. You walk for 
            approximately 10 minutes but then you met an dead end and there is no other 
            way. So you realized you had chosen the wrong way. You start to go back to 
            the main road; but suddenly an alarm goes off and several security bots are 
            heading in your direction and their guns are pointed to your head.
