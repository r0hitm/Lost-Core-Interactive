            You reach the Central Alestrex by 10:00 am, and are walking towards the 
            central tallest structure that is the pride of the Alestrex. It titled 
            "The Core of Alestrex", however what the real name was of the structure 
            is lost with the time. Suddenly you bump into a man wearing black Armour 
            and carrying guns. He is one of Alestrex Security Force. Central Alestrex
            is normally closed to normal citizens.
            
            “Hey kid, what are you doing here? It’s illegal to enter these areas w/o permission.” 
            yelled the guard. 
            You showed the guard your Permission card that you’ve received from the Security Minister. 
        
            “You are the lad who managed to pass HS. Very well then” 
            He lets you pass. You walk straight down the road where it splits into three.
